      <font color="white">Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not<br>fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the rays.<br>However, the term "shark" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha, such as<br>Cladoselache and Xenacanthus, as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans.</font>
    <font size="+2"><b><li>Natural habitat</li></b></font>
      <font color="white">Sharks are very adaptable creatures, which means that they can change and adjust to survive.<br>Sharks are also fierce predators, and can feed on many different ocean animals. Since they are so adaptable and have a broad availability of food,<br>they can move around frequently.<br>Sharks do not make a home in one particular area to live in. Unlike a bird that builds a nest or a beaver that constructs a dam, sharks do not build homes.<br>The main reason for this is that most sharks have to swim continually<br>and move to breathe.<br>
          An animal's habitat is the place or area in which they live. Sharks are a type of fish, which means that<br>they breathe through gills and need to live in the water. But you don't have to worry that you will run into a shark when you step into a pond, river or lake<br>because most sharks live in the ocean. Sharks are found living in many different bodies of water around the world. Just like most animals,<br>different species of sharks prefer different types of water.</font>
    <font size="+2"><b><li>History</li></b></font>
      <font color="white">Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450-420 million years ago,<br>before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree<br>that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from<br> about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period.<br>The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. At this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with<br>three tines like a trident, apparently to help catch fish.The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth,<br>often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils.<br>The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.</font>
